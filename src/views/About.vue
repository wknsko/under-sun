            <p><strong>Under Sun</strong> eyewear is entirely handmade in California by three artisanal families, who
                build
                each frame from start to
                finish using traditional methods of production in order to deliver an authentic and noble product.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Under Sun</strong> preserves Cali values and heritage through hard work by real people who have
                spent their lives
                specializing in this meticulous line of craftsmanship. The result is a genuine product that translates
                excellence through passion and authenticity.

                Only the best materials are put into work and the design should be reflected by being timeless,
                minimalistic
                and classic â€“ with a modern touch. Glasses in premium acetate with polarized lenses and a genuine
                leather
                case are all a part of our premium package.
